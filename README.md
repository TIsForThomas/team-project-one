## What is it?

For this first team project, we were tasked with creating a website that utilized both a front-end framework and 2 APIs that would preform functions when called. With these specifications we decided to make this website be an event finder that utilizes the SeatGeek API to find events in a selected city, and the the MapBox API that displays a map and populates the map with markers that contain event information

## How to use it:

- First, type a city name into the search bar at the top of the webpage and press enter. This will populate the map with all of the events in that city ![Search Bar](/assets/Screenshots/search-bar.png)

- Then, use the buttons to narrow down your search to the event type (currently there are 3 with room for more in future builds) ![Buttons](/assets/Screenshots/buttons.png)

- Last, click through the cards to see the event information to decide what you want to go see! We even included a link to SeatGeek so you can buy tickets! ![Search Bar](/assets/Screenshots/populated-map.png)

## What do we use?

For our first API we use SeatGeek, which is a list of upcoming events all over the country that gives us things like price, date, venue, performer, etc..

Our second API was MapBox, which is an interactive map much like Google Maps that we can put coordinate points on.

## How do we use it?

We use SeatGeek to pull future events such as concerts, theater performances, and sports games and index them by city so when you search for a specific city those events would populate on the map.

We use MapBox to display a map on the page and populate event cards on the map that contain the event information.
